## MINUTIAE

You must put your phone in portrait mode and be sure that the finger from you are trying to extract the Minutiae is focused properly and well illuminated, then press ""Take Picture"" and wait.
Note: sometimes if you tap over the image of the finger it gets a better focus.

This is an example of how the app performs.
